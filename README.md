This repository is designed for a case study focused on predicting employee attrition for Frito Lay. This project includes data exploration, visualizations, and predictive modeling to help the executive team understand the key factors driving attrition within the company.

## Project Overview

In the first phase of this project, we conducted an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, **CaseStudy1-data.csv**. This dataset provides a foundation for understanding the factors that may influence employee retention. Our findings were presented to the executive team, focusing on trends and insights drawn from the data.

Following the initial presentation, we leveraged a secondary dataset, **CaseStudy1CompSet No Attrition.csv**, to build a predictive model. This model aims to identify employees at risk of leaving the company and determine the primary factors.

## Project Goal

Our primary objective is to create a reliable model to predict future attrition within the organization. By analyzing attrition patterns, we aim to highlight the most significant factors contributing to employee turnover, enabling the company to implement strategies to improve retention.

## Key Attrition Factors

Based on our analysis, the following factors have been identified as the most influential in employee attrition:

| #  | Factor                                        |
|----|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Overtime                                      |
| 2  | Young professionals who travel for work       |
| 3  | Monthly Income and daily travel               |

## Project Structure

The **README.md** file provides a high-level summary of the projectâ€™s objectives and findings. The **notebook** file walks through the following key steps in detail:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization steps are explained to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

2. **Visualization Design**  
   - We discuss how visualizations were chosen and designed to communicate data insights effectively to the executive team.

3. **Model Development**  
   - **Final Model**: A predictive model to identify future attrition risk, using the most significant factors found in my analysis.
   - **Alternate Model**: A secondary model developed as part of our experimentation process but ultimately not used for the final predictions due to Specificity being under 60% 

This project showcases both data science techniques and business insights, providing a holistic approach to solving the attrition problem at Frito Lay.
